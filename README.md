# **Bank Household Analysis Dashboard**

The **Bank Household Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive application designed to analyze household-level financial data, empowering banks and financial institutions with actionable insights. By aggregating and analyzing customer demographics, financial metrics, and household patterns, this dashboard enables tailored financial strategies, accurate risk assessments, and effective customer segmentation.

Key features include:
- **Household Detection**: Group customers based on shared attributes like last names and addresses.
- **State-wise Income Distributions**: Analyze income variations across U.S. states.
- **Regression Models for Income Prediction**: Predict household income using demographic and financial attributes.
- **Classification Models for Creditworthiness Evaluation**: Identify high-creditworthiness households with precision.

### **Built with Streamlit**
This dashboard leverages **Streamlit** for a seamless user experience, integrating:
- **Pandas** for robust data manipulation and processing.
- **Plotly** for dynamic, interactive visualizations.
- **XGBoost** and other machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- **Faker** for generating synthetic data to replicate real-world financial datasets.

### **Project Highlights**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Interactive visualizations uncover patterns in customer demographics, income, credit scores, and household sizes.
   - Heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots illustrate correlations and key trends.

2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**:
   - Aggregated household-level metrics (e.g., total income, average age, credit scores).
   - Created new features like "Income per Member" and "High Creditworthiness."

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Ridge Regression**: Used for predicting total household income with strong explanatory power (RÂ² = 0.85).
   - **Logistic Regression**: Effectively classifies households into high or low creditworthiness groups with high precision and recall.

4. **Real-world Application**:
   - Mimics real-world challenges by introducing 20% artificial missingness and performing imputation.
   - Provides insights into household financial behaviors to support decision-making in the banking sector.
