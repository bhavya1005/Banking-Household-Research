### Bank Household Analysis Dashboard

The **Bank Household Analysis Dashboard** is a powerful tool designed to provide insights into household-level financial data, enabling banks and financial institutions to make data-driven decisions. This dashboard allows users to explore customer demographics, financial metrics, and household patterns through interactive visualizations and advanced modeling techniques. By analyzing aggregated household data such as income, credit scores, and age, the dashboard helps banks better understand their customer base, enabling tailored financial products, risk assessments, and customer segmentation strategies. Key features include household detection, state-wise income distributions, regression models for income prediction, and classification models for creditworthiness evaluation.

Built using **Streamlit**, this dashboard leverages robust data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to deliver actionable insights. Users can navigate through various sections, including an overview of the dataset, detailed household metrics, and advanced analytical results. The app not only showcases a practical implementation of data science in the banking sector but also demonstrates the use of tools like Pandas, Plotly, and XGBoost.
