In this analysis, households are identified by grouping customers who share the same last name and residential address.
Households with more than one member are considered for this page, as they provide meaningful insights for banks.

### Why Identify Households?
- **Customer Segmentation**: Households can be treated as a unit for financial product offerings.
- **Better Insights**: Aggregated data reveals financial capacity and creditworthiness at the household level.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Banks can design services tailored to household needs, such as loans or family-oriented accounts.
